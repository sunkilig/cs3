    <p>NCT is an abbreviation of 'Neo Culture Technology', and as it was created as a new cultural technology, it is a completely new concept group with 'openness' and 'extensibility' as the main points, free recruitment of members, and no limit on the number of members.
	Under the brand NCT, each team based in cities around the world will debut sequentially, and plans to continuously showcase various combinations and transformations of members through 'NCT U'.</p>
